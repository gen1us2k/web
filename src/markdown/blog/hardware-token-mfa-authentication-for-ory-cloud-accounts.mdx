Multi-factor authentication ensures that your Ory Cloud account is secured even if your credentials have been compromised. 

Ory Cloud currently offers two second factors to choose from: 

* Authenticator App 
* Hardware Token

An Authenticator App is an application on e.g. your mobile device that generates a time-based one-time-password (TOTP); generally a six digit code that is valid for ~60 seconds.

A Hardware Token is a physical device that stores cryptographic keys to generate one-time passwords (other methods of authentication are also supported by hardware tokens).

Multi-factor authentication for Ory Cloud leverages the FIDO2 open authentication standards which include both WebAuthentication (web APIs for passwordless authentication in browsers) and CTAP protocols.

In this guide we are going to add a Hardware Token "Yubikey" to our Ory Cloud account in 3 easy steps.


Hardware tokens come in many different sizes & shapes. One of the most widespread is the Yubico Yubikey. I am going to use the [Yubikey 5](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-5-overview/) with a USB-C connector in this guide, but it will work just the same with other models.

## Adding Yubikey to Ory Cloud

For this guide you just need your Ory Cloud account and have the Yubikey or other hardware token on hand.

1. Log into console.ory.sh & open the settings page.
2. Type the name of your security key.   
   In my case it is Yubikey, but you can name your security key whatever you feel like.  
3. Hit "Add Security Key" and connect your Yubikey.  
   Plug in your Yubikey and when you see the symbol blinking with a green light, touch it to activate the Yubikey. 

_That is it, we are done!_ ðŸ¥³

Your Ory Cloud project is now protected with the Hardware Token "Yubikey". 

When you login the next time, you will use your credentials/social login as before.

Then you get a prompt to `Please complete the second authentication challenge`.

Connect the Yubikey and press the `Use Security Key` button. Now your Yubikey blinks with a green light. Touch it to activate and complete your authentication.

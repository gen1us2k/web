      We believe that today's "digital identity" is fundamentally flawed. There
      are too many profiles, registration screens, passwords, privacy
      violations, data leaks, phishing attacks, and data mining operations out
      there. Our vision is to make the internet more secure and private with
      better software, open-source, and open knowledge. Ory is the largest
      open-source authentication and authorization (login, registration, MFA,
      permissions, OAuth2,...) ecosystem and community in the world. We develop
      open-source software and use it to build a scalable, easy-to-use, and
      secure cloud platform.

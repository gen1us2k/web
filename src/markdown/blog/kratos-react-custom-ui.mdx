Add authentication and user management to your [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
[React](https://reactjs.org) app using the new
[Next.js Edge Runtime](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/edge-runtime) and
the [Ory Kratos open source project](https://github.com/ory/kratos)!

## Ory Kratos Open Source Identity Platform

[Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) is a full-featured, free, and open
source authentication and identity management platform. It supports multi-factor
authentication with
[FIDO2, TOTP, and OTP](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/two-factor-authentication-2fa-mfa/);
[Social Sign In](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/guides/sign-in-with-github-google-facebook-linkedin/),
[custom identity models](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/next/concepts/identity-schema/);
registration, profile management, account recovery, administrative user
management and so much more! In contrast to other identity systems,
[Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) enables you to build your own
[login](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pages/login.tsx),
[registration](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pages/ui/registration.tsx),
[account settings](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pages/ui/settings.tsx),
[account verification](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pages/ui/verification.tsx)
(e.g. email, phone, activate account),
[account verification](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pages/ui/recovery.tsx)
(e.g. reset password) user interfaces and user flows using dead-simple APIs.

This guide focuses on writing your own UI using Ory Kratos' APIs. If you are
interested in just adding login and authentication to your app, check out
[Add Authentication to your Next.js / React Single Page Application (SPA)](/nextjs-authentication-spa-custom-flows-open-source)

Before we start, let's get some terminology out of the way:

- At Ory, identity can mean any actor in a system (user, robot, service account,
  ...). The term `user` always refers to a human being sitting in front of a
  browser or mobile app.
- A session refers to a user's session in a browser or mobile app after they
  have authenticated.
- Self-Service refers to flows the user can do on their own - such as login,
  registration, and so on. It does not require administrative / support
  intervention.

## Add Login to your React / NextJS

If you want to see a live demo right away,
[check out this app in action](https://kratos-reference-ui-react-nextjs.vercel.app).

<video autoplay muted loop playsInline>
  <source
    src="../../images/articles/kratos-reference-ui/app.mp4"
    type="video/mp4"
  />
  <source
    src="../../images/articles/kratos-reference-ui/app.webm"
    type="video/webm"
  />
</video>

The code for this app is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs). To give it
a spin, clone it and run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs.git
cd kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs
npm i
```

Per default, this app uses the public playground deployment of Ory Kratos at
`https://playground.projects.oryapis.com`. If you want to use your own Ory
Kratos instance, you can use the `ORY_KATOS_URL` or `ORY_SDK_URL` environment
variable. The easiest way to run Ory Kratos is in an
[Ory Cloud Project](https://www.ory.sh/docs/start-building/create-project)
_(free for developers)_! In that case, set the `ORY_SDK_URL` to your
[project's SDK url](https://www.ory.sh/docs/concepts/services-api):

```
# If you run Ory Kratos in Ory Cloud:
export ORY_SDK_URL=https://my-project.projects.oryapis.com
```

You may also run Ory Kratos yourself. A quick way to get started is to run the
Ory Kratos Docker quickstart:

```shell
git clone --depth 1 --branch master https://github.com/ory/kratos.git
cd kratos
git checkout master
git pull -ff
docker-compose -f quickstart.yml -f contrib/quickstart/kratos/cloud/quickstart.yml up --build --force-recreate -d
```

In that case, set the `ORY_SDK_URL` to your local Ory Kratos instance:

```shell
# If you run Ory Kratos locally using the Docker quick start:
export ORY_KRATOS_URL=http://localhost:4455/

# Start the app
npm run dev
```

Next head over to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to see the
app in action with login, registration - a working user management!

### Ory Kratos Configuration in Ory Cloud

To get everything to work smoothly, we recommend setting the appropriate UI
endpoints in your Ory Cloud Project under the "User Interface" menu item. If you
are developing locally on port `3000` this would be:

- Login UI: `http://localhost:3000/login`
- Registration UI: `http://localhost:3000/registration`
- Settings UI: `http://localhost:3000/settings`
- Verification UI: `http://localhost:3000/verification`
- Recovery UI: `http://localhost:3000/recovery`
- Error UI: `http://localhost:3000/error`

![Ory Cloud Project User Interface Configuration](/images/articles/kratos-react-vercel-next/ui-settings.png)

Also, ensure to set up your redirects correctly, so you end up at the right
endpoint after you have signed up or signed in!

![Ory Cloud Project User Interface Configuration](/images/articles/kratos-react-vercel-next/redirects.png)

We are setting these values to ensure that all flows (e.g. clicking on that
password reset link) end up at your application. If you deploy to production,
set these values to your production URL!

## Start with the Next.js Typescript Template

To start from scratch, initialize the NextJS App and install Ory's SDKs and
integration packages:

```
npx create-next-app --ts
npm i --save @ory/kratos-client @ory/integrations
```

To make the UI beautiful, we also install Ory's theme package. You can of course
use your own styling framework (e.g. [Material UI](https://mui.com/) or
[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)).

```
npm i --save @ory/themes
```

We also want to send notifications to users in case something goes wrong. For
that, we will install
[React Toastify](https://github.com/fkhadra/react-toastify):

```
npm install --save react-toastify
```

### Adding Next.js Edge Function to Integrate with Ory Kratos

To make everything run smoothly, we will add Ory's integration library and
include it in Next.js Edge Runtime. To do so, add a new file under
`pages/api/.ory/[...paths].ts` with the following contents:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/d026c7f0c2f296bf38947810d9394b05f927d6a0/pages/api/.ory/%5B...paths%5D.ts"
/>

Setting up the SDK to interact with Ory Cloud's APIs is just a few lines of
code:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/d026c7f0c2f296bf38947810d9394b05f927d6a0/pkg/sdk/cloud.ts"
/>

### Rendering the Registration Form

Great, now all the preconditions are met! Let's start with the first page we
want to implement: the registration form!

#### Preparing the Registration Page

First we need to initialize the state and get the
[Self-Service Registration Flow ID](https://www.ory.sh/kratos/docs/self-service/flows/user-registration)
from the URL:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pages/registration.tsx"
  startAt="const Registration: NextPage"
  endAt="const { flow: flowId, return_to: returnTo } = router.query"
/>

#### Initializing or Fetching a Registration Flow

Next, we create an effect which will fetch the registration flow and set the
state. The registration flow contains information about the registration form,
e.g. the fields and validation messages to be displayed:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pages/registration.tsx"
  startAt="  // In this effect we either"
  endAt=" }, [flowId, router, router.isReady, returnTo, flow])"
/>

As you can see, if the flow ID is not available, we will initialize a new
registration flow (`initializeSelfServiceRegistrationFlowForBrowsers`). If it is
set, we will fetch the flow from the API (`getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow`).

#### Preparing Registration Form Submission

When the user submits the form, we will call the
`submitSelfServiceRegistrationFlow` method of the SDK to submit the form:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pages/registration.tsx"
  startAt="const onSubmit ="
  endAt="   return Promise.reject(err)"
/>

#### Rendering the Registration Form

Finally, we render the registration form:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pages/registration.tsx"
  startAt="    <>"
  endAt="</>"
/>

## Rendering the Forms

Great, we have now initialized the registration flow and have everything
prepared to render the form. Rendering the form is the same for all flows
(login, registration, recovery, ...). The [`<Flow onSubmit={onSubmit}
flow={flow} />` React
Component])(https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pkg/ui/Flow.tsx)
will render the form and handle the form state. The component itself is a bit
longer because we deal with the form state, errors, and the form submission
without any helper tools such as Formik. In essence, it iterates over the
Registration Form's `ui.node` values which we received from
`initializeSelfServiceRegistrationFlowForBrowsers` /
`getSelfServiceRegistrationFlow` earlier:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pkg/ui/Flow.tsx"
  startAt=" render() {"
  endAt="</form>"
/>

Then, for each node, it decides what HTML input to render:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/af4ab647b6ea3f55da359742a629dd00af1bf217/pkg/ui/NodeInput.tsx"
/>

The simplest HTML input to render is the hidden input field. Basically you just
add the attributes to the HTML element:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/f413a1a14e6d849a509cda8232253cdd5b2fbf45/pkg/ui/NodeInputHidden.tsx"
/>

Rendering a normal input field looks similar:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/f413a1a14e6d849a509cda8232253cdd5b2fbf45/pkg/ui/NodeInputDefault.tsx"
/>

Ory Kratos' forms can contain several types of nodes:

- [text inputs](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeInputDefault.tsx)
- [buttons](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeInputButton.tsx)
- [checkboxes](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeInputCheckbox.tsx)
- [hidden fields](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeInputHidden.tsx)
- [scripts](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeScript.tsx)
- [text](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeText.tsx)
- [image](https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/pkg/ui/NodeImage.tsx)

These are needed to show, for example, QR codes for TOTP, scripts for WebAuthn,
text for recovery codes, buttons for social sign in, and so on!

#### Dealing With Flow Errors

Usually, Ory Kratos takes care of redirecting to the correct endpoints and
showing the right messages. With Single Page Apps though you need to deal with
errors yourself. Ory Kratos conveniently returns error IDs which you can use to
identify errors and handle accordingly:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/f413a1a14e6d849a509cda8232253cdd5b2fbf45/pkg/errors.tsx"
/>

### Rendering the Recovery Page

Rendering the recovery form is the same as the registration form, but with a few
minor changes:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/6f4e65f8f0a9070a602523bb5dd3dfbd58b56735/pages/recovery.tsx"
/>

### Rendering the Verification Page

Rendering the verification form is the same as the registration form, but with a
few minor changes:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/6f4e65f8f0a9070a602523bb5dd3dfbd58b56735/pages/verification.tsx"
/>

### Rendering the Account Settings Page

Rendering the account settings form is the same as the registration form, but
with a few minor changes:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/6f4e65f8f0a9070a602523bb5dd3dfbd58b56735/pages/settings.tsx"
/>

### Rendering the Login Page

The login page is a bit more work to render! That is because we want to support
two-step authentication and we need to deal with any two-factor authentication
errors by e.g. logging the user out.

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="tsx"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/6f4e65f8f0a9070a602523bb5dd3dfbd58b56735/pages/login.tsx"
/>

### Form Rendering Conclusion

That was quite a bit of code, but it's all there is to it! If you do not want to
implement these UI screens yourself, use the reference implementations for Ory
Kratos instead, or clone this repository and use it as a base for your project!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs.git
```

## Deploy to Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the
[Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new) from the creators of Next.js. If you
have never deployed on Vercel, check out the
[Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more
details. Deploying the app is easy. Ensure that your build works by running

```
npm run build
```

Then, set up your [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) account and create a new app.
You will need to configure your
[Ory Cloud Project SDK URL](https://www.ory.sh/docs/concepts/services-api) or
the URL of your self-hosted Ory Kratos instance in your Vercel deployment:

![Add Ory Cloud SDK URL to Vercel](/images/articles/auth-react-next-vercel/vercel-env-var.png)

By the way! If you want to use separate Ory Kratos deployments for staging,
production, and development then use different SDK URLs for the different
environments by un/selecting the checkboxes in the Vercel UI:

![Use a development project for development Vercel](/images/articles/auth-react-next-vercel/vercel-dev.png)

![Use a production project for production Vercel](/images/articles/auth-react-next-vercel/vercel-prod.png)

If you want to call Ory Cloud's Admin APIs from your Next.js Edge serverless
functions, optionally set up the
[Ory Personal Access Token](https://www.ory.sh/docs/guides/create-personal-access-token):

![Connect Vercel with Ory Personal Access Token](/images/articles/auth-react-next-vercel/vercel-secret.png)

Next all you need to do is to run the deploy command and connect it to the
project you created:

```
npx vercel deploy --prod
```

This also works with Vercel PR Preview!

## End-to-End Tests

Adding end-to-end tests is also easy! Clone the repository and run the following
commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs.git
cd kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs
npm i
```

Then, depending on your setup, you can either use Ory Kratos local or deployed
in Ory Cloud:

```shell
export ORY_KRATOS_URL=https://playground.projects.oryapis.com/
```

Then, build and start the server

```shell
npm run dev
```

and in a new shell run the end-to-end tests:

```
npm run test:dev
```

You can find the full spec file in the `cypress/integration/pages.spec.js` file:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/cypress/integration/pages.spec.js"
/>

The GitHub Action file is also straight forward and contains two configurations,
one for running Ory Kratos locally and one for running Ory Kratos in Ory Cloud:

<CodeFromRemote
  lang="js"
  src="https://github.com/ory/kratos-selfservice-ui-react-nextjs/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml"
/>

## Conclusion

Adding login and registration to your Next.js app is a breeze with open source
technology like [Ory Kratos](https://github.com/ory/kratos) and
[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

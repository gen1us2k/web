<About />
<DeveloperGeneric />

### Overview

- **Position type:** Full Time
- **Location**: Munich, Germany / Remote (Timezone CET ± 3H)
- **Components**: Ory Cloud Console, Ory Open Source

### What You'll Do

- Engage in and improve the whole lifecycle of services — from inception and
  design through to deployment, operation and refinement.
- Support services before they go live through activities such as system design
  consulting, developing software platforms and frameworks, capacity planning,
  and launch reviews.
- Maintain services once they are live by measuring and monitoring availability,
  latency, and overall system health.
- Scale systems through mechanisms like automation; evolve systems by pushing
  for changes that improve reliability and velocity.
- Practice sustainable incident response and blameless postmortems.

### We’re looking for someone who has

- A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a related technical field involving
  systems engineering.
- Experience with Unix/Linux operating systems internals and administration
  (e.g., filesystems, inodes, system calls) or networking (e.g., TCP/IP,
  routing, network topologies).
- Experience analyzing and troubleshooting systems.
- Motivation to debug, optimize code, automate routine tasks, and design
  large-scale distributed systems.
